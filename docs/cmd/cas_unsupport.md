## cas unsupport

Unsupport an asset

### Synopsis


Change an asset's status so it is equal to UNSUPPORTED.

Unsupport command calculates the SHA-256 hash of a digital asset
(file, directory, container's image).
The hash (not the asset) and the desired status of UNSUPPORTED are then
cryptographically signed by the signer's secret (private key).
Next, these signed objects are sent to the CAS where the signer’s
trust level and a timestamp are added.
When complete, a new CAS entry is created that binds the asset’s
signed hash, signed status, level, and timestamp together.

Note that your assets will not be uploaded. They will be processed locally.

Assets are referenced by passed ARG(s) with unsupport command only accepting
1 ARG at a time.


ARG must be one of:
  wildcard
  file
  directory
  file://<file>
  git://<repository>
  docker://<image>
  podman://<image>
  wildcard://"*"

cas unsupport [flags]
```

### Examples

```
cas notarize my-file
echo my-file | cas n -
```

### Options

```
      --api-key string                Community Attestation Service api key
  -a, --attr key=value                add user defined attributes (repeat --attr for multiple entries)
      --cert string                   local or absolute path to a certificate file needed to set up tls connection to a Community Attestation Service
      --ci-attr                       detect CI environment variables context if presents and inject 
      --enforce-signature-verify      if this flag is provided cas will disable signature auto trusting when connecting to a new Community Attestation Service
      --hash string                   specify the hash instead of using an asset, if set no ARG(s) can be used
  -h, --help                          help for unsupport
      --host string                   if set with host, action will be route to a Community Attestation Service
  -n, --name string                   set the asset name
      --no-tls                        allow insecure connections when connecting to a Community Attestation Service
      --port string                   set port for set up a connection to a Community Attestation Service (default 443). If --no-tls is provided default port will be 80
      --signing-pub-key string        specify a public key to verify signature in messages when connected to a Community Attestation Service. It's required a valid ECDSA key content without header and footer. Ex: --signing-pub-key="MFkwE...y5i4w=="
      --signing-pub-key-file string   specify a public key file path to verify signature in messages when connected to a Community Attestation Service. If no public key file is specified but server is signig messages is possible an interactive confirmation of the fingerprint. When confirmed the public key is stored in ~/.cas-trusted-signing-pub-key file.
      --skip-tls-verify               disables tls certificate verification when connecting to a Community Attestation Service
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --caspath string   config files (default is /tmp/.cas/config.json on linux, c:\temp\config.json or c:\windows\temp\config.json on Windows)
  -o, --output string    output format, one of: --output=json|--output=''
  -S, --silent           silent mode, don't show progress spinner, but it will still output the result
      --verbose          if true, print additional information
```
